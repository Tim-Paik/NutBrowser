      HEREIN.
    </p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>"Software" or "mobileFX Software"</b> is a bundle of (i) mobileFX
        Component (ii) third party software, in each case, supplied by mobileFX
        herewith, (iii) corresponding documentation, associated media, printed
        materials, online or electronic documentation and (iv) samples.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"mobileFX Component"</b> is the portion of mobileFX Software required
        in order for the End User Desktop Application to operate on hardware on
        which mobileFX Software itself is not resident. For the scope of this
        agreement the named mobileFX Software is <b>WebKitX CEF3 ActiveX</b>,
        that can be downloaded from https://www.webkitx.com. WebKitX ActiveX
        wraps Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF3) for use with OLE/COM languages
        and implements technologies for inter-process communication between
        mobileFX ActiveX and Chromium Embedded Framework. The wrapping consists
        of: (i) an ActiveX Control created and owned entirely by mobileFX and
        (ii) an out-of-process executable that wraps Chromium Embedded Framework
        obtained from http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html. For
        the scope of this Agreement, only OLE/COM wrapper is offered and
        supported as a product by mobileFX.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Third Party"</b> for the scope of this agreement is Chromium
        Embedded Framework (CEF3) of which a precompiled publicly available
        version of CEF3 is bundled with the mobileFX Software in order to
        demonstrate how CEF3 binaries should be copied alongside mobileFX
        Software. CEF3 is a BSD-licensed open source project based on the Google
        Chromium project. mobileFX does not sell you Chromium Embedded Framework
        binaries or other 3rd party software.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"End User Desktop Application"</b> means an output file, typically a
        software application executable developed and generated by you, which
        contains the mobileFX Software.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"End User"</b> is Customer’s clients, operators or agents: any person
        within the Customer’s operational environment that will use mobileFX
        Software.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Not-For-Resale (NFR) Version" or "Trial Version"</b> means a
        version, so identified, of mobileFX Software to be used to review and
        evaluate mobileFX Software, only.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"mobileFX"</b> means mobileFX Studio Ltd and its licensors, if any.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Perpetual Commercial License for Desktop Application Development" or
          "Commercial License"</b>: a single Commercial License allows developing an unlimited number of
        Windows Desktop Applications linked with mobileFX Software and
        distribution of those applications to an unlimited number of end-user
        desktop computers. Customer is required to obtain one license per
        Developer Workstation and Build Server. The license is perpetual and is
        validated OFF-LINE with a License Key that must be hard-coded in
        Customer’s software sources or with a License File that must be
        distributed along with the End User Desktop Application. Commercial
        License explicitly excludes non-desktop application development such as
        Terminal, Virtual and Embedded applications.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Developer UUID"</b>: our licensing policy requires each Developer
        Workstation and Build Server in your environment to be licensed with an
        equal amount of Commercial Licenses. To satisfy this agreement we ask
        you to bind your Commercial License with every Developer Workstation and
        Build Server. mobileFX Software generates a hash of your Developer
        Workstation or Build Server that consists of your computer name and
        hashes of hardware devices such as your hard disk, motherboard, etc.
        This hash is the Developer UUID and each computer has a unique hash.
        Validation of the computer takes place ONLY when you are at design-time,
        that is when you use mobileFX Software from your IDE like Visual Studio,
        Visual Basic, Delphi, etc. Validation of the Developer Workstation NEVER
        takes place at runtime, so in other words it never takes place when your
        software runs in end-user computers. Our Developer UUID hash is future
        proof, meaning that if you need to upgrade faulty components of your
        Developer Workstation or Build Server, such as the Hard Disk, then as
        long as 4 out of 6 Developer UUID hashes remain the same, you are
        entitled to quest a new Workstation Activation code.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Subscription-based Commercial License for Terminal Software
          Development" or "Terminal License"</b>: complementary to Perpetual Commercial License for Desktop Application
        Development is subscription-based Terminal Licensing. Terminal Licensing
        is required <b>if-and-only-if</b> an application linked with mobileFX
        Software is deployed on Windows Embedded operating systems, or deployed
        through Terminal Services, or Virtual Appliances. Terminal services
        include any remote session such as Remote Desktop, Citrix Clients and
        Terminal Server Clients, and any Virtualization container such as
        VMware, Virtual Box, VSphere, Docker, Parallels, etc. The term Terminal
        applies to distinct terminal client devices and not distinct terminal
        end-users. mobileFX Software has API properties that can be used to
        determine if such licensing is required on the target device prior to
        purchase. The same Terminal License will work for operating system
        changes or upgrades as well as hardware and software changes or
        upgrades. The same Terminal License will work when changing between
        Citrix and other terminal services such as Remote Desktop. The Terminal
        License is not end-user-bound and any end-user can use the same
        terminal. Terminal License issuing, duration, expiration and volumes
        depend on commercials negotiated with mobileFX prior to Terminal License
        generation and are not governed by this Agreement.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Terminal UUID"</b> similarly, our licensing policy requires each
        Terminal Network to be licensed with an equal amount of Terminal
        Licenses. To satisfy this agreement we ask you to bind your Commercial
        License with every Terminal. mobileFX Software generates a distinct hash
        for each Terminal that consists of the Terminal name and hashes of
        hardware devices such as your hard disk, motherboard, etc. This hash is
        the Terminal UUID and each computer terminal has a unique hash.
        Validation of the Terminal License takes place every time a Terminal is
        detected: (i) ON-LINE per Terminal with transmission of the Terminal
        UUID to our license server, available to Customers with Standard
        Licensing terms; or (ii) OFF-LINE per Terminal with an encrypted License
        File, available to Customers with Standard Licensing terms; or (iii)
        OFF-LINE with a wildcard Terminal License Key, available to Customers
        with Professional Licensing terms; or (iv) OFF-LINE with a wildcard
        Terminal License Key, available to Customers with Enterprise Licensing
        terms. Our Terminal UUID hash is future proof, meaning that if you need
        to upgrade faulty components of a Terminal, such as the Hard Disk, then
        as long as 4 out of 6 Terminal UUID hashes remain the same, you are
        entitled to quest a new Terminal Activation code.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <b>"Device Licensing"</b>:
      complementary to Perpetual Commercial License for Desktop Application Development is Device Licensing.
      Device Licensing applies to Independent Hardware Vendors (IHV) and it is required <b>if-and-only-if</b>
      a software linked with mobileFX Component is distributed as part of, or embedded in, a Hardware Product, 
      such as but not limited to IoT Devices and Gateways, POS Devices, Self Service Terminals, Vending Machines, 
      Digital Signage Kiosks, Automation Devices, ATM Devices, etc.      
      Device License issuing, duration, expiration and volumes depend on commercials negotiated 
      with mobileFX prior to Device License generation and are not governed by this Agreement.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Hot Fixes"</b> is an amendment in mobileFX Software that when
        compiled produces a minor-version product upgrade. Hot Fixes are offered
        only for mobileFX Component and not for third party software such as
        Chromium Embedded Framework.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Critical Incidents"</b> are incidents where (i) mobileFX Software
        cannot run on any one of the target operating systems, (ii) mobileFX
        Software crashes during the execution of any of the expected scenarios,
        (iii) mobileFX Software does not respect the configuration provided,
        (iv) mobileFX Software cannot be deployed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Bugs"</b> is any logical, or functional, or security defect in
        mobileFX Component that can be treated with a Hot Fix. mobileFX
        Component Bugs are treated at mobileFX's discretion and prioritization
        normally on following minor releases. Treating Bugs with priority or
        treating Bugs causing Critical Incidents is subject to support
        commercials.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Support Request - SR"</b> is any request for support or training
        placed by the Customer that mobileFX has competences to serve. For the
        scope of this Agreement, SRs are any requests for consultation related
        to: (i) integrating mobileFX Software with COM enabled programming
        languages Visual Basic 6.0, Delphi, Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019, (ii)
        HTML5 and CSS3 consultation, (iii) WebGL consultation, (iv) mobileFX
        Software API consultation, (v) mobileFX Software packaging and
        deployment consultation, (vi) mobileFX Software configuration for
        operation within Embedded Operating Systems, (vii) Remote Terminals and
        Terminal Servers and Virtual Appliances. SR are&nbsp;subject to support
        commercials.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Change Request – CR"</b> is any request for the design and
        implementation of new features in mobileFX Software’s Application
        Programmable Interface (API) including: (i) implementation of
        proprietary API as per Customer’s functional specifications, (ii)
        integration with peripherals such as printers, scanners, etc. as long as
        peripheral hardware and SDKs are provided by the Customer, (iii) CEF3
        security updates with commit identifier bf8cff2 or later, (iv)
        integration of mobileFX Software with different version of CEF3 with
        commit identifier bf8cff2 or later, (iv) Critical Functional Updates.
        CEF3 commit identifiers for version 71.3578.1860 are in
        https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/branch/3578. CR are subject to support commercials.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"HMRC"</b> is Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, is a non-ministerial
        department of the UK Government responsible for the collection of taxes,
        the payment of some forms of state support and the administration of
        other regulatory regimes including the national minimum wage. UK
        companies doing business overseas are bound to currency exchange rates
        as defined by HMRC at the following web site address:<br>

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>"Service Hours &amp; Business Days"</b> is mobileFX’s working
        business and service hours at GMT+0 time zone. Those are from 09:00 AM
        to 17:00 PM from Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>License Grants</h2>

    The license of mobileFX Software is subject to the terms and conditions set
    forth in this Agreement:

    <ol>
      <li>
        You may install and use the licensed mobileFX Software for DEVELOPMENT
        PURPOSES to any number of Developer Workstations or Build Servers within
        your premises; OR install and store the licensed mobileFX Component on a
        storage device, such as a network server, used only to install the
        licensed mobileFX Component on your other developer workstations over an
        internal network.
      </li>

      <li>
        Except solely for purposes of installing the licensed mobileFX Software
        on Customer’s developer workstations and build servers as described
        above, the licensed mobileFX Software may be used in Customer’s
        PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, including QA, sandbox and staging environments,
        and accessed via a server or network storage device, including without
        limitation through Citrix and Citrix-type environments, Remote Desktops,
        Virtual Appliances or Embedded operating systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        The intended use of a licensed mobileFX Software is to be used by the
        Customer for developing an unlimited number of End User Desktop
        Applications for commercial use within Customer’s premises and
        operations network. To avoid any conflict of interest, mobileFX
        prohibits you from using mobileFX Software for developing commercial
        and/or non-commercial software components that wrap mobileFX Component
        and could pose/become competitor of mobileFX business. The key
        difference between a software application (allowed) and a software
        component (prohibited) is that a software component is used as an
        integral part on building software applications.
      </li>

      <li>
        You may make any number of copies of the licensed mobileFX Software in
        machine-readable form for backup purposes. You must reproduce on any
        such copy all copyright notices and any other proprietary legends of the
        original copy of the licensed mobileFX Software. You may not sell or
        transfer any copy of the licensed mobileFX Software made for backup
        purposes. A license for the mobileFX Software may not be shared,
        installed or used on third party computers. Subject to the terms and
        conditions set forth in this Agreement, you shall not have more than one
        installation of the licensed mobileFX Software on any single production
        computer.
      </li>

      <li>
        In addition, you may make copies of your End User Desktop Applications
        and the associated mobileFX Component, and distribute those copies;
        provided, however, that: (i) the mobileFX Software may not be
        distributed or used other than as bundled with the output executable as
        part of the End User Desktop Application, and (ii) you shall require
        each party to whom the End User Desktop Application is distributed to
        agree that no title to, or ownership rights in the mobileFX Software are
        transferred and that the End User Desktop Applications, including the
        mobileFX Software, shall not be reverse compiled or disassembled.
      </li>

      <li>
        You agree that mobileFX may audit your use of mobileFX Software for
        compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the
        event that such audit reveals any use of mobileFX Component other than
        in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, you shall reimburse
        mobileFX for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition
        to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such
        non-compliance.
      </li>

      <li>Your license rights under this Agreement are non-exclusive.</li>

      <li>
        Mandatory Product Activation: the Commercial License rights of mobileFX
        Software granted under this Agreement are perpetual for Windows Desktop

        Software, the Customer must supply information required for activating
        all developer workstations and build servers within thirty (30) days.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>No Terminal License rights are granted under this Agreement</b>.
      </li>

      <li>
        There are technological measures in mobileFX Software that are designed
        to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of mobileFX Software. You agree
        that mobileFX may use those measures and you agree to follow any
        requirements regarding such technological measures.
      </li>
    </ol>

        Software and could pose/become competitor of mobileFX business.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the event that you fail to comply with this Agreement, mobileFX may
        terminate the license and you must destroy all copies of the Software
        (with all other rights of both parties and all other provisions of this
        Agreement surviving any such termination).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Upgrades</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        For the duration of this agreement, Customer will be entitled to free
        minor-version upgrades of his last licensed major-version as per its

        version's end user license agreement with respect to the installation

        Software binds you to the terms and conditions of upgraded version
        License Agreement. Any terms and conditions of the previous license
        agreement of earlier versions are replaced by the terms and conditions
        of latest version. This also means that (i) any privileges, offers or
        discounts received by the earlier version will no longer be offered by

    <h2>Limited Support</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the duration of this agreement, Customer can apply for bounty-based
        support for Support Requests (SR) and Change Requests (CR) at
        time-and-material fixed man-hour rate. mobileFX reserves the right to
        refuse any SR or CR for any reason and the service is provided with an
        "if-possible" condition decided by mobileFX and mobileFX only. Support
        is offered ONLY to customers with Licensed mobileFX Software.
      </li>

      <li>
        Change Requests are performed on the latest published minor-version,
        they cannot be performed for previous minor-versions and customization
        and/or extensions are implemented as long as they do not require source
        code branching and maintain binary compatibility with other customers.
      </li>

      <li>
        SRs and CRs require prior communication by email in order to be arranged
        and depend on mobileFX engineer’s availability at the time of request.
        Minimum effort for support request is two (2) man-hours. 
        For serving Change Requests the following professionals are
        engaged and their man-hours are accumulated: (i) Project Manager, (ii)
        Senior Software Engineer, (ii) Test Engineer. Minimum effort for change
        request is eight (8) man-hours.
      </li>
      
      <li>

      right to alter its rates without prior notice.      
      Exchange Rates to other currencies are defined by HMRC.
      Man-hour rates for off-hours (no-work hours) are doubled.
      Man-hour rates for weekends and bank holidays are tripled.
      Minimum man-hour work-hours rates for fiscal year 2020 are 100 GBP.
      The rate is provided for estimations and does not commit mobileFX.
      </li>

      <li>
        Requesting mobileFX for support even without prior arrangement still
        binds you to Support terms and mobileFX reserves the right to demand
        compensation by invoicing you according to the Limited Support terms and
        rates of this Agreement. You must not contact mobileFX for support
        if you disagree with those support terms.
